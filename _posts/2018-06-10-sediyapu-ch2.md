Now let's turn to "laya" in chandaḥ-śāstras.<cite>70 0.104 0.370</cite>

(Some places where the term occurs in passing—)

A metre named laya-grāhi, 1.<cite>70 0.367 0.602</cite>

A metre named laya-grāhi, 2.<cite>70 0.600 0.899</cite><cite>71 0.105 0.262</cite>

A metre named utsāha.<cite>71 0.258 0.517</cite>

Another example (layottara).<cite>71 0.515 0.656</cite>

What can we infer from these examples?<cite>71 0.652 0.840</cite>

The first two are akṣara-vṛtta, and happen to have "samate" even in parts (chunks) of a pāda<cite>71 0.837 0.895</cite><cite>72 0.109 0.403</cite>

The last chunk. Interesting. (And debatable IMO: is this really always exactly true? But it doesn't affect his point.)<cite>72 0.398 0.520</cite>

In these two examples, the different chunks shared both the "time to say the chunk" (number of mātrās) and the actual LG pattern. Which one is meant by "laya"?<cite>72 0.519 0.680</cite>

Example 3. (There's a typo; third chunk should be LLL, not GLL.)<cite>72 0.680 0.910</cite><cite>73 0.111 0.194</cite>

Example 4. (**examine these examples closely**) <cite>73 0.194 0.763</cite>

These latter two (mātrābandha-s) have only mātrā equality. This establishes what they meant by "laya".<cite>73 0.756 0.943</cite><cite>74 0.115 0.175</cite>

Why isn't laya really discussed in the works?<cite>74 0.173 0.500</cite>

Because those works only aim to define precisely, not to discuss beauty... and laya is not needed for defining a given pattern<cite>74 0.510 0.712</cite><cite>78 0.113 0.393</cite><cite>79 0.106 0.202</cite>

Discussed in music/dance.<cite>80 0.106 0.388</cite>

Start of Footnote 20: Vṛtta and jāti. [This footnote spans 5 pages, and I have marked it more heavily than anything in the main chapter itself...]<cite>74 0.699 0.941</cite>

[Footnote 20 continued] Vṛtta = the entire GL sequence completely fixed; jāti = fewer things fixed. [Note the footnote within a footnote here!]<cite>75 0.141 0.358</cite>

[Footnote 20 continued] Vṛtta is not always used carefully in a definite sense...<cite>75 0.334 0.438</cite>

[Footnote 20 continued] More elaboration on 'vṛtta'. [Much of it is obvious IMO; some funny criticism of Halayudha.]<cite>75 0.418 0.837</cite>

[Footnote 20 continued] jāti, simply defined.<cite>75 0.817 0.911</cite>

[Footnote 20 continued] More on jāti: called so because the similarity is less / is of a generic nature. [Also: "...ಇತ್ಯಾದಿ ಏನೇನೋ ಅನುಮಾನಿಸಿದ್ದಾರೆ." :-)]<cite>76 0.144 0.702</cite>

[Footnote 20 continued] But jāti ≠ mātrābandha. E.g. upajāti!<cite>76 0.680 0.908</cite>

[Footnote 20, part 2: basically a new footnote] Anuṣṭup an akṣara-jāti. ("ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತವಾಙ್ಮಯದ ಅಧಿಕಭಾಗವನ್ನು ಆಕ್ರಮಿಸಿ ಮೆರೆಯುತ್ತಿರುವ ಅನುಷ್ಟುಪ್ ಶ್ಲೊಕ...")<cite>76 0.884 0.922</cite><cite>77 0.129 0.273</cite>

[Footnote 20, part 2, continued] How to classify Anuṣṭup<cite>77 0.252 0.909</cite>

[Footnote 20, part 2, continued] Why (and how) anuṣṭup should be under jāti.<cite>78 0.395 0.908</cite>

(Repeating from above)<cite>78 0.595 0.658</cite>

[Start of Footnote 21] Chandaḥ-śāstra's goal is not to illuminate chando-gati. It isn't even possible, within scope.<cite>79 0.210 0.505</cite>

[Footnote 21 continued] Those forms (pada etc) are not both pāṭhya and geya like chandas, only geya.<cite>79 0.482 0.711</cite>

[Footnote 21 continued] Tāla not mentioned doesn't mean it doesn't apply; in fact the opposite is true. Not many have noticed this.<cite>79 0.686 0.907</cite>

[Back to main text] So why mention "laya" at all? Note it is only mentioned in works written in metres, when having to write a few words beyond the definition — not part of the definition itself.<cite>80 0.386 0.890</cite><cite>81 0.118 0.371</cite>

[Footnote 22] Three meanings of laya: (1) equality (2) speed (or equality thereof) (3) other equality/one-ness. For us, only (1) is relevant.<cite>81 0.559 0.944</cite>

In summary, I think in this chapter the meaning of "laya" was hamerred in again, with a couple of useful illustrative examples. Separately, footnote 20 (really, the footnotes in this book sometimes constitutte a separate book in themselves, that happens to be running parallel to the main book) has a great discussion of vṛtta and jāti. We can say there are degrees of looseness: vṛtta < upajāti < {anuṣṭubh, mātrā-bandhas}. Many authors choose to analyze upajāti as a mixture of two vṛttas, everyone classifies the mātrā-bandhas as jāti, and many are not quite sure what to do about anuṣṭubh. But having seen it clearly like this, we can make up our mind.
