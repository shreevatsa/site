Chapter 4: Chandas and gati — a look at the meaning of "chandas"<cite>92 0.105 0.202</cite>

Like 'laya', the term 'gati' is not needed for defining a metre. But it is crucial in any discussion of the metre's quality / beauty.<cite>92 0.193 0.651</cite>

Fn 28.<cite>92 0.786 0.918</cite>

First, what is chandas?<cite>92 0.646 0.756</cite><cite>93 0.106 0.166</cite>

The word “chandas”. We don't have to worry about its etymology.<cite>93 0.166 0.361</cite>

A long footnote on its etymology. :-) Anyway, shows why it isn't important.<cite>93 0.361 0.899</cite>

Interesting sentence from the above. The traditional Indian and Western methods and goals of etymology.<cite>93 0.700 0.825</cite>

Quotes from sources<cite>94 0.107 0.542</cite>

Summary / listing of meanings. (**Read this, referred to later.**)<cite>94 0.537 0.907</cite><cite>95 0.102 0.313</cite>

Original meaning was just ”padya”; the study thereof is a secondary meaning.<cite>95 0.313 0.511</cite>

1, 2, 3, are meanings born of analysis; (4) extends them to cover "padya".<cite>95 0.483 0.708</cite>

Property, and thing that has property.<cite>96 0.110 0.282</cite>

Fn 30: Amara's definition agrees with Piṅgala.<cite>95 0.708 0.933</cite>

In Bharata<cite>96 0.275 0.519</cite>

Typo in book. OK OK :-)<cite>96 0.600 0.912</cite>

Chandas = pattern of L and G (Obvious stuff?)<cite>96 0.514 0.584</cite><cite>97 0.106 0.900</cite><cite>98 0.108 0.267</cite>

Echoed in Jayakīrti<cite>98 0.267 0.502</cite>

raghaṭā<cite>98 0.476 0.835</cite>

Fn 32: Jayakīrti has written a great work.<cite>98 0.835 0.913</cite><cite>99 0.131 0.370</cite>

Fn 32 continued: On raghaṭā. Originally only ra-s (GLG); later other 5s substitutable. Etc. (More details.)<cite>99 0.346 0.905</cite>

Fn 32 continued: Even more on raghaṭā (especially historically)<cite>100 0.138 0.796</cite>

Fn 32, part 2: Inference about origins of ṣaṭpadi [Didn't understand this; need to come back later]<cite>100 0.773 0.893</cite><cite>101 0.600 0.909</cite>

What we've seen so far: (1) chandas = padya (originally) (2) By extension, chandas-śāstra is called chandas too. (3) [more definitions] (4) applies to all speech.<cite>101 0.108 0.554</cite>

Then is gadya (prose) also chando-badda? Well, no.<cite>102 0.099 0.397</cite>

[Clarification of everything] chandas = LG pattern. When pattern is apparent (uniformity, etc), is padya. Constrained, unconstrained.<cite>102 0.394 0.904</cite>
