Message from the system at Berkeley, October 2009:

```
Oct  2: Warning: Due to a known bug, the default Linux document viewer
        evince prints N*N copies of a PDF file when N copies requested.
        As a workaround, use Adobe Reader acroread for printing multiple
        copies of PDF documents, or use the fact that every natural number
        is a sum of at most four squares.
```

For confirmation that this is real, see [here](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/3596/is-there-a-simple-way-to-compute-the-number-of-ways-to-write-a-positive-integer) and [here](https://math.berkeley.edu/computing/wiki/index.php?title=Support:Old_News&oldid=3483).

Note that this is [Lagrange's four-square theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lagrange%27s_four-square_theorem&oldid=872275094), not to be confused with [other theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lagrange%27s_theorem&oldid=776598676) also called Lagrange's theorem. And Dario Alpern has [a great webpage that decomposes an integer as a sum of squares](https://www.alpertron.com.ar/FSQUARES.HTM), including a [proof](https://www.alpertron.com.ar/4SQUARES.HTM).
