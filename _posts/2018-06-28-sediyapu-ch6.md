This the longest chapter so far, though Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 we'll see are even longer. In this chapter Sediyapu presents one of his new theories. There are many things in this book that are perfectly obvious in hindsight, and enormously clarifying, and yet no one in the history of Indian prosody seems to have pointed out earlier. 

And there are also a few things that are subjective, as we will see.

Chapter 6: On different kinds of chandogati (Āvarta-gatis)<cite>128 0.092 0.198</cite>

Let's start with a footnote, as it spans 4 pages. :-)

[Start of Footnote 48] Practically any words can be sung to a rhythm; we call something a *padya* only if its syllables imply a rhythm, fit to a rhythm.<cite>128 0.297 0.547</cite>

Such padya are sama or viṣama gati. (Other to-be-sung compositions, like "pada"s, are always samagati.)<cite>128 0.524 0.671</cite>

But even many samagati / satāla-bandhas are sung without tāla. [Unfortunately, I know neither these metres nor these tālas, so I can't understand this part at the moment.]<cite>128 0.647 0.928</cite><cite>129 0.124 0.813</cite>

Something very perceptive, and one of several such remarks in the book:

Two spectrums (spectra?):  
(1) harṣotpādaka v/s saumya, gambhīra, prasannate, ēkāgrate  
(2) Pay attention to sound v/s Pay attention to meaning.  
Laya, especially when druta, pushes the reader closer to the left end of both the above spectra.<cite>129 0.807 0.902</cite><cite>130 0.130 0.353</cite>

This is the reason for traditions of singing vitāla.<cite>130 0.329 0.552</cite>

IMO this is all fine, but there is an unacknowledged tension with the reason for writing *padya* (rather than *gadya*) in the first place. After all, if one very much wants all attention to meaning and none to sound, then writing prose (*gadya*) would be even better. So this is a matter of balance, of taste and subjectivity, rather than absolutes. (Not that he's stated it as such; just making it clear for myself...)

But many satāla are sung vitāla and vice-versa (e.g. Vande Mataram); it doesn't change their basic nature. [End of footnote 48]<cite>130 0.534 0.907</cite><cite>131 0.343 0.718</cite>

Now we can start reading the actual text part of the chapter :-)

## Kinds of akṣara-gati and kinds of āvarta-gati

In Chapter 3, we saw all gatis are samagati (having tāla, laya) or not. And in Chapter 5, we saw druta, vilambita, etc., based on the proportion of laghus and gurus. (Orthogonal, and fuzzy -- hard to precisely classify or say anything based on that).<cite>128 0.188 0.306</cite><cite>131 0.105 0.325</cite>

Fn 49: But people have tried. Attempts at noticing gati, evidence from name "druta-vilambita".<cite>131 0.710 0.907</cite><cite>132 0.523 0.893</cite>

I claim that in samagati padyas, can actually say something about drutatva etc. No one has done it before, but let me try. First, some examples.<cite>132 0.093 0.496</cite><cite>133 0.100 0.187</cite>

Group I.<cite>133 0.183 0.447</cite>

Group II.<cite>133 0.441 0.766</cite>

Group III.<cite>133 0.756 0.911</cite><cite>134 0.102 0.258</cite>

[Aside: If some day this work is translated out of Kannada, having consistently Sanskrit examples everywhere may be nice...]

When we read them uniformly / naturally, we seem to perceive speed of I < II < III.<cite>134 0.252 0.424</cite>

You have to experience it for yourself. "idu anubhavaika-vedya" as said above -- we'll encounter this again.

But the reason here cannot be the "more G / more L" classification of Śārṅgadeva. So what is it?<cite>134 0.399 0.588</cite>

5, 4, 3!<cite>134 0.537 0.727</cite>

We perceive the repetition sooner/later, so faster/slower.<cite>134 0.700 0.878</cite><cite>135 0.108 0.165</cite>

Fn 50: These are only apparent / perceived / "illusory" gatibheda, not actual change in speed of utterance as in music. [Repetitive IMO, but reread if you didn't understand.]<cite>135 0.258 0.907</cite>

Conclusion from what we've seen so far: there are *two* kinds of druta etc: (1) Akṣara-gati-bheda (more Gs or Ls, as described by SRK), (2) Āvarta-gati-bheda, only for layānvita bandhas, being described here for the first time by SKB.<cite>135 0.157 0.244</cite><cite>136 0.087 0.569</cite>

Fn 51 [Maybe this would have even fit in an earlier chapter, but it's a fair question that may arise here]: Isn't *any* samavṛtta layānvita, as it has repetition? E.g. in music we have tāla of duration 30 etc. Answer: Such long āvartas are not perceptible without special musical training; only up to ~8 are. ...[Some philosophy about what padya should be]... Otherwise, not just all samavṛttas, but even ardhasama and even almost all padya (except a few like Anuṣṭup) could be called layānvita / said to have repetition/āvarta!<cite>136 0.571 0.899</cite><cite>137 0.127 0.902</cite><cite>138 0.571 0.789</cite>

In all layānvitabandhas, both akṣaragati and āvartagati present, but (especially other than satāna-bandhas, i.e. mātrābandhas or vitānavṛttas), the āvartagati is *more* prominent. [Because the akṣaragati has variations...]<cite>136 0.530 0.565</cite><cite>138 0.107 0.383</cite>

There are some intricacies. See Fn 52 that follows.<cite>138 0.368 0.566</cite>

Also see the last sentence above; it's one of the reasons this topic is so difficult and elusive. :-)

[Start of Fn 52.] When there are chandaḥkhaṇḍas that are full of laghus, the akṣaragati's drutatva is perceptible (whatever the āvartagati).<cite>138 0.785 0.878</cite><cite>139 0.130 0.501</cite>

Similarly, chunks with gurus $\implies$ vilambita akṣaragati perceptible.<cite>139 0.498 0.719</cite>

ja-gaṇa perceptible.<cite>139 0.713 0.821</cite>

Even though 4-4, the yati / word-break as G-LGL stands out: pause and jump.<cite>139 0.802 0.896</cite><cite>140 0.385 0.916</cite>

[This would be a perfect time for me to be sceptical, but actually I perceived it...]

See examples of both gatis being apparent.<cite>140 0.555 0.681</cite>

Another summary: akṣaragati is prominent in case of (1) no laya, (2) something repeated more than once (including satāna-vṛttas), (3) special things like "pluti", or jagaṇa. (Consider: Śikhariṇī, Mandākrāntā, Śālinī.) Else, āvartagati prominent. [End of Fn 52]<cite>140 0.675 0.922</cite>

Sounds perfectly correct once stated, but what a fine ear, and what clear thinking, are needed to state these, without getting confused!

Now back to the main text...

## Gatis formed from combinations of these āvartagatis

Combinations of our 3, 4, 5 āvartagatis.<cite>140 0.116 0.366</cite>

4+5 is too long to be clearly perceptible/attractive. And 3+5 is confusable with 4+4, so needs some help from a G after 3, and/or yati. (See Fn 54.)<cite>141 0.110 0.463</cite><cite>142 0.101 0.409</cite>

Fn 53. [To me this seems to be clarifying something that seems obvious, in fact I don't understand how it could be different, so what is being pointed out. I'm probably missing something. Anyway...] mātrāgaṇa = āvarta = sequence of L/G with total duration $n$ for some $n$. Sanskrit works on prosody consider only $n = 4$, Kannada 3, 4, 5, Prakrit 2 to 6, Urdu up to 7 but with some constraints.<cite>141 0.479 0.917</cite>

[Start of Fn 54] $3 + 5$ in Rathoddhatā, using G.<cite>142 0.580 0.790</cite>

Examples of avoiding 4+4 through either G or word-break (yati).<cite>142 0.785 0.911</cite><cite>143 0.139 0.608</cite>

Note: This shows that word breaks matter! A simplistic treatment of prosody says they shouldn't matter, but I've long suspected they do -- pleased to be right! (In fact I suspect they do even in Anuṣṭup, but we'll come to that later.)

Sometimes not strictly followed in recent or lesser works. (And vice-versa: 4+4 metres can occasionally have 3+5.) Might be OK though.<cite>143 0.585 0.807</cite>

Example. One is 4+4 (2nd chunk of second line); rest are 3+5.<cite>143 0.800 0.906</cite><cite>144 0.135 0.215</cite>

First pāda is 4+4 (madhyāvartagati); rest are 3+5 (druta-vilambitāvartagati).<cite>144 0.215 0.490</cite>

Some weirdness of "varaṇa" in verses(?) of the "pada" genre. [I'm ignoring for now.]<cite>144 0.490 0.903</cite><cite>145 0.140 0.259</cite>

[Separate footnote, sharing same number] 8s are always confusable: 3+5 could also be 5+3.<cite>145 0.255 0.419</cite>

Examples (3+5 then 5+3)<cite>145 0.413 0.614</cite>

The distinctive gati comes not from being breakable as 3+5 or 5+3, but from being *not* 4+4, because of syllables 4 and 5 being blended by G (or start of word). So let's call it "sankalita-madhyāvartagati" instead: new name. [End of Fn 54.]<cite>145 0.591 0.909</cite>
