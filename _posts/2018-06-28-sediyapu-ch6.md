This the longest chapter so far, though Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 we'll see are even longer. In this chapter Sediyapu presents one of his new theories. There are many things in this book that are perfectly obvious in hindsight, and enormously clarifying, and yet no one in the history of Indian prosody seems to have pointed out earlier. 

And there are also a few things that are subjective, as we will see.

Chapter 6: On different kinds of chandogati (Āvarta-gatis)<cite>128 0.092 0.198</cite>

Let's start with a footnote, as it spans 4 pages. :-)

[Start of Footnote 48] Practically any words can be sung to a rhythm; we call something a *padya* only if its syllables imply a rhythm, fit to a rhythm.<cite>128 0.297 0.547</cite>

Such padya are sama or viṣama gati. (Other to-be-sung compositions, like "pada"s, are always samagati.)<cite>128 0.524 0.671</cite>

But even many samagati / satāla-bandhas are sung without tāla. [Unfortunately, I know neither these metres nor these tālas, so I can't understand this part at the moment.]<cite>128 0.647 0.928</cite><cite>129 0.124 0.813</cite>

Something very perceptive, and one of several such remarks in the book:

Two spectrums (spectra?):  
(1) harṣotpādaka v/s saumya, gambhīra, prasannate, ēkāgrate  
(2) Pay attention to sound v/s Pay attention to meaning.  
Laya, especially when druta, pushes the reader closer to the left end of both the above spectra.<cite>129 0.807 0.902</cite><cite>130 0.130 0.353</cite>

This is the reason for traditions of singing vitāla.<cite>130 0.329 0.552</cite>

IMO this is all fine, but there is an unacknowledged tension with the reason for writing *padya* (rather than *gadya*) in the first place. After all, if one very much wants all attention to meaning and none to sound, then writing prose (*gadya*) would be even better. So this is a matter of balance, of taste and subjectivity, rather than absolutes. (Not that he's stated it as such; just making it clear for myself...)

But many satāla are sung vitāla and vice-versa (e.g. Vande Mataram); it doesn't change their basic nature. [End of footnote 48]<cite>130 0.534 0.907</cite><cite>131 0.343 0.718</cite>

Now we can start reading the actual text part of the chapter :-)

## Kinds of akṣara-gati and kinds of āvarta-gati

In Chapter 3, we saw all gatis are samagati (having tāla, laya) or not. And in Chapter 5, we saw druta, vilambita, etc., based on the proportion of laghus and gurus. (Orthogonal, and fuzzy -- hard to precisely classify or say anything based on that).<cite>128 0.188 0.306</cite><cite>131 0.105 0.325</cite>

Fn 49: But people have tried. Attempts at noticing gati, evidence from name "druta-vilambita".<cite>131 0.710 0.907</cite><cite>132 0.523 0.893</cite>

I claim that in samagati padyas, can actually say something about drutatva etc. No one has done it before, but let me try. First, some examples.<cite>132 0.093 0.496</cite><cite>133 0.100 0.187</cite>

Group I.<cite>133 0.183 0.447</cite>

Group II.<cite>133 0.441 0.766</cite>

Group III.<cite>133 0.756 0.911</cite><cite>134 0.102 0.258</cite>

[Aside: If some day this work is translated out of Kannada, having consistently Sanskrit examples everywhere may be nice...]

When we read them uniformly / naturally, we seem to perceive speed of I < II < III.<cite>134 0.252 0.424</cite>

You have to experience it for yourself. "idu anubhavaika-vedya" as said above -- we'll encounter this again.

But the reason here cannot be the "more G / more L" classification of Śārṅgadeva. So what is it?<cite>134 0.399 0.588</cite>

5, 4, 3!<cite>134 0.537 0.727</cite>

We perceive the repetition sooner/later, so faster/slower.<cite>134 0.700 0.878</cite><cite>135 0.108 0.165</cite>

Fn 50: These are only apparent / perceived / "illusory" gatibheda, not actual change in speed of utterance as in music. [Repetitive IMO, but reread if you didn't understand.]<cite>135 0.258 0.907</cite>

Conclusion from what we've seen so far: there are *two* kinds of druta etc: (1) Akṣara-gati-bheda (more Gs or Ls, as described by SRK), (2) Āvarta-gati-bheda, only for layānvita bandhas, being described here for the first time by SKB.<cite>135 0.157 0.244</cite><cite>136 0.087 0.569</cite>

Fn 51 [Maybe this would have even fit in an earlier chapter, but it's a fair question that may arise here]: Isn't *any* samavṛtta layānvita, as it has repetition? E.g. in music we have tāla of duration 30 etc. Answer: Such long āvartas are not perceptible without special musical training; only up to ~8 are. ...[Some philosophy about what padya should be]... Otherwise, not just all samavṛttas, but even ardhasama and even almost all padya (except a few like Anuṣṭup) could be called layānvita / said to have repetition/āvarta!<cite>136 0.571 0.899</cite><cite>137 0.127 0.902</cite><cite>138 0.571 0.789</cite>

In all layānvitabandhas, both akṣaragati and āvartagati present, but (especially other than satāna-bandhas, i.e. mātrābandhas or vitānavṛttas), the āvartagati is *more* prominent. [Because the akṣaragati has variations...]<cite>136 0.530 0.565</cite><cite>138 0.107 0.383</cite>

There are some intricacies. See Fn 52 that follows.<cite>138 0.368 0.566</cite>

Also see the last sentence above; it's one of the reasons this topic is so difficult and elusive. :-)

[Start of Fn 52.] When there are chandaḥkhaṇḍas that are full of laghus, the akṣaragati's drutatva is perceptible (whatever the āvartagati).<cite>138 0.785 0.878</cite><cite>139 0.130 0.501</cite>

Similarly, chunks with gurus $\implies$ vilambita akṣaragati perceptible.<cite>139 0.498 0.719</cite>

ja-gaṇa perceptible.<cite>139 0.713 0.821</cite>

Even though 4-4, the yati / word-break as G-LGL stands out: pause and jump.<cite>139 0.802 0.896</cite><cite>140 0.385 0.916</cite>

[This would be a perfect time for me to be sceptical, but actually I perceived it...]

See examples of both gatis being apparent.<cite>140 0.555 0.681</cite>

Another summary: akṣaragati is prominent in case of (1) no laya, (2) something repeated more than once (including satāna-vṛttas), (3) special things like "pluti", or jagaṇa. (Consider: Śikhariṇī, Mandākrāntā, Śālinī.) Else, āvartagati prominent. [End of Fn 52]<cite>140 0.675 0.922</cite>

Sounds perfectly correct once stated, but what a fine ear, and what clear thinking, are needed to state these, without getting confused!

Now back to the main text...

## Gatis formed from combinations of these āvartagatis

Combinations of our 3, 4, 5 āvartagatis.<cite>140 0.116 0.366</cite>

4+5 is too long to be clearly perceptible/attractive. And 3+5 is confusable with 4+4, so needs some help from a G after 3, and/or yati. (See Fn 54.)<cite>141 0.110 0.463</cite><cite>142 0.101 0.409</cite>

Fn 53. [To me this seems to be clarifying something that seems obvious, in fact I don't understand how it could be different, so what is being pointed out. I'm probably missing something. Anyway...] mātrāgaṇa = āvarta = sequence of L/G with total duration $n$ for some $n$. Sanskrit works on prosody consider only $n = 4$, Kannada 3, 4, 5, Prakrit 2 to 6, Urdu up to 7 but with some constraints.<cite>141 0.479 0.917</cite>

[Start of Fn 54] $3 + 5$ in Rathoddhatā, using G.<cite>142 0.580 0.790</cite>

Examples of avoiding 4+4 through either G or word-break (yati).<cite>142 0.785 0.911</cite><cite>143 0.139 0.608</cite>

Note: This shows that word breaks matter! A simplistic treatment of prosody says they shouldn't matter, but I've long suspected they do – pleased to be right! (In fact I suspect they do even in Anuṣṭup, but we'll come to that later.)

Sometimes not strictly followed in recent or lesser works. (And vice-versa: 4+4 metres can occasionally have 3+5.) Might be OK though.<cite>143 0.585 0.807</cite>

Example. One is 4+4 (2nd chunk of second line); rest are 3+5.<cite>143 0.800 0.906</cite><cite>144 0.135 0.215</cite>

First pāda is 4+4 (madhyāvartagati); rest are 3+5 (druta-vilambitāvartagati).<cite>144 0.215 0.490</cite>

Some weirdness of "varaṇa" in verses(?) of the "pada" genre. [I'm ignoring for now.]<cite>144 0.490 0.903</cite><cite>145 0.140 0.259</cite>

[Separate footnote, sharing same number] 8s are always confusable: 3+5 could also be 5+3.<cite>145 0.255 0.419</cite>

Examples (3+5 then 5+3)<cite>145 0.413 0.614</cite>

The distinctive gati comes not from being breakable as 3+5 or 5+3, but from being *not* 4+4, because of syllables 4 and 5 being blended by G (or start of word). So let's call it "sankalita-madhyāvartagati" instead: new name. [End of Fn 54.]<cite>145 0.591 0.909</cite>

We saw why 4+5 is unlikely, and discussed 3+5. The other one, 3+4, is very common.<cite>146 0.100 0.212</cite>

Examples.<cite>146 0.207 0.307</cite><cite>147 0.098 0.257</cite>

Fn 55: Someone says some "akṣara vṛttas" are "mātrāvṛttas"; this is not so. [Needless harsh criticism IMO; just a matter of definitions and someone being sloppy...]<cite>146 0.320 0.906</cite><cite>147 0.652 0.900</cite>

A couple of points of note from the above:

...<cite>146 0.663 0.728</cite>

Most vṛttas are samagati, i.e. layānvita = satāla.<cite>146 0.744 0.812</cite>

This is another observation that becomes obvious in hindsight on examining the data, yet before Sediyapu Krishna Bhat no one seems to have made. Truly a mark of genius (IIRC something Huxley said about Darwin is similar).

Repeating the end of Fn 54: 3+5 = 5+3 chunks are formed by overriding 4+4, with a G after 3, i.e. occupying 4 & 5 — by blending/bridging (saṃdhāna) of the two 4s.<cite>147 0.246 0.637</cite>

(...contd) Even when achieved with yati rather than G, this is what is going on. [An innocuous-looking claim tucked away in brackets, but actually quite subtle and may not be easy to understand how 1+1— i.e. word break starting at 4, becomes saṃdhāna.]<cite>148 0.107 0.191</cite>

Beautiful: just as blended 4+4 is distinctive, so is blended 3+3.<cite>148 0.164 0.339</cite>

Examples I. [The second group is LLGG; the asterisk is a footnote.]<cite>148 0.334 0.544</cite>

Examples II. [In (a), Line 1, third group is 4+2, similarly first group of line 3. Typo in second group of line 2: it is LLGLL.]<cite>148 0.538 0.911</cite>

Examples III.<cite>149 0.098 0.414</cite>

Same: This gati comes when 3+3 is prevented, by 3&4 being joined by a G (as in I)...<cite>149 0.411 0.604</cite>

... or with a yati after 2 or 4 (as in II)...<cite>149 0.576 0.818</cite>

... or... in other ways. [This one is subtler and I didn't hear it the first time.]<cite>149 0.789 0.899</cite><cite>150 0.107 0.185</cite><cite>151 0.105 0.242</cite>

[Read these examples carefully and convince yourself... or not.]<cite>151 0.207 0.435</cite>

[Start of Fn 56] One may ask: why is GLLG not 3+3? <cite>150 0.194 0.339</cite>

Answer: Just listen to it. (Also: "...heccukaḍame...")<cite>150 0.316 0.442</cite>

Aside: In mathematics books, sometimes the author writes that something is "obvious" or "trivial", and sometimes readers get upset when it's *not* obvious or trivial to them. I think something similar happens in this book in some places, and sometimes this comes off as a bit frustrating. It is one thing to say "unfortunately, this is hard to explain, and you have to experience it for yourself". It *feels* different, possibly insulting, when stated as "If you have any sense at all, you will know this already". :-) Could this be one of the secondary reasons this great book is not universally adored by everyone who's read it?

The reason for sounding this way: GL↘ and LG↗, etc. <cite>150 0.417 0.614</cite>

★A very subtle and important point [buried within parentheses in a footnote]!<cite>150 0.590 0.713</cite>

Similar with LLLLG<cite>150 0.689 0.899</cite>

Example. [End of Fn 56]<cite>151 0.693 0.896</cite>

Summary / reiteration.<cite>151 0.432 0.696</cite>

Like the 8 that is not 4+4, this one too requires special circumstances.<cite>152 0.106 0.251</cite>

And can sometimes accommodate 3+3.<cite>153 0.105 0.265</cite>

Example of 3+3 intruding (in fact, 5 times out of 14).<cite>153 0.255 0.537</cite>

Name: Similarly, let's call it saṃkalita drutāvartagati.<cite>153 0.531 0.619</cite>

[Start of Fn 57] Many of the {3, 4} metres seem to have additional constraints (the 3 can't be LG, and the 4 can't be LGL); so is this really a generic class of metres? Yes it is.<cite>152 0.255 0.488</cite>

Just is. (Kannada doesn't have gaṇas starting with LG.)<cite>152 0.461 0.714</cite>

Example of 3+4<cite>152 0.681 0.903</cite>

And 4+3. [End of Fn57]<cite>153 0.745 0.901</cite>

## The six kinds of gati from changes in āvarta-gati

Collecting what we saw so far...<cite>153 0.606 0.739</cite>

3–8, so 6 (main) kinds.<cite>154 0.105 0.335</cite>

I. Drutāvartagati = 3 <cite>154 0.326 0.481</cite>

II. Madhyāvartagati = 4<cite>154 0.471 0.643</cite>

III. Vilambitāvartagati = 5<cite>154 0.643 0.793</cite>

IV. Druta-madhyāvartagati = {3, 4}<cite>154 0.793 0.902</cite><cite>155 0.100 0.165</cite>

[Fn 58: Example.]<cite>155 0.295 0.877</cite>

V. Saṃkalita-drutāvartagati = 6 that is not 3+3<cite>155 0.159 0.284</cite><cite>156 0.105 0.310</cite>

[Fn 59: Their prevalance, contra Ti Nam Shri's Samālokana.]<cite>156 0.394 0.909</cite>

VI. Saṃkalita-madhyāvartagati = 8 that is not 4+4.<cite>156 0.301 0.383</cite><cite>157 0.103 0.323</cite>

(IMO: From a mathematical point of view, we can quite simply classify these by ["fundamental period"](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Periodic_function&oldid=844384788#Definition) — if something has fundamental period 6, then it does not have period 3, etc., so these six classes are simply something like: period 3, 4, 5, 7, 6, 8, and it is not necessary to distinguish the last two. But he does...)

Names: 3, 4, 5, 7 v/s 6, 8.<cite>157 0.320 0.558</cite>

Fn 60: Ṣaṭpadi (LOL)<cite>157 0.750 0.879</cite>

Another: 4+3=7. Example.<cite>157 0.554 0.739</cite>

3+4 and 4+3 tend to cancel each other out. Example of Vasantatilakā!<cite>158 0.106 0.329</cite>

Fn 61: An example of 4+3 from "pada" genre from Yakṣagāna, needs stretching / shrinking so we'll ignore for now.<cite>158 0.475 0.895</cite>

Also: trimūrti (aṃśa) gaṇa not discussed; they need to be read specially, and when done so, fits what we have.<cite>158 0.301 0.475</cite><cite>159 0.105 0.187</cite>

[Start of Fn 62] trimūrti gaṇa, not read as written [I'm ignoring for now...]<cite>159 0.206 0.601</cite>

More...<cite>159 0.577 0.891</cite>

More (Yakṣagāna, etc.) (One thing of note: with pauses and so on, any layānvita chandobandha's gati can be changed — that has no bearing.)<cite>160 0.127 0.884</cite>

Even more....<cite>161 0.113 0.800</cite>

Sounding vilambita<cite>161 0.776 0.887</cite><cite>162 0.635 0.756</cite>

More. [End of Fn 62.]<cite>162 0.749 0.895</cite>

## Variation in layānvita bandhas: endless variety

Variation (in the actual concrete LG pattern, and in yati) leads to great variety.<cite>162 0.106 0.367</cite>

Two examples of Udgatā<cite>162 0.367 0.634</cite><cite>163 0.111 0.293</cite>

Aside: I used to struggle reading Udgatā, and now suddenly, magically, after having read so far into the book, it sounds good. That is after all the purpose of undertaking this study, to be able to appreciate beauty more.

Note: the terms samavṛtta and viṣamavṛtta are just about how broken into pādas, they are not about the gati of the composition.<cite>163 0.261 0.410</cite>

Notation.<cite>163 0.381 0.547</cite>

In Udgatā, some are 3+5 and some are 4+4.<cite>163 0.520 0.618</cite>

The two examples differ in first āvarta of 2nd half, because of yati: 3+5 [IMO 5+3 to be precise, but the point is the same] v/s 4+4.<cite>163 0.589 0.891</cite><cite>164 0.099 0.168</cite>

## On the gati of kanda-padya

5 kandapadyas from Kavi-rāja-mārga<cite>164 0.168 0.898</cite>

Kandapadya is the majority of Haḷegannaḍa. Constraints on 6th gaṇa, and 1357 can't be jagaṇa. [IMO "can't be jagaṇa" is equivalent to "can break as 2+2"... but maybe that's not the intention.]<cite>165 0.101 0.329</cite>

Many variations manifest.<cite>165 0.303 0.399</cite>

Apparent even in the five examples just given.<cite>165 0.373 0.445</cite>

Example of (c). The āvartagati recedes to background. (b) seems to be of āvarta 6. In (c), the 4-gati remains strong [?] In (a) and (c), the akṣaragati are more prominent.<cite>165 0.416 0.907</cite><cite>166 0.099 0.313</cite>

Fn 63: If you ignore the meaning & yati, and read by gaṇas, then the simple 4-gati stands out.<cite>166 0.361 0.652</cite>

Fn 63: Details of the further constraints on 6, 8 or 9 etc.<cite>166 0.631 0.905</cite>

There are definitely things in this chapter I have not understood. But what I've understood is already large and highly valuable. :-)
