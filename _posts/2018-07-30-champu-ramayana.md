Bhojaraja, fondly remembered by literary history as one of India's greatest kings, has written a Champu Ramayana that is often regarded as the best *campū-kāvya* in Sanskrit. This is a beautiful work in *campū* (a mixture of *gadya*, prose, and *padya*, verse) that follows the story of Vālmīki's Rāmāyaṇa closely, but compresses it a great deal, and embellishes it with the most beautiful *alaṅkāra*s: particularly noticeable (to me) are the *prāsa* and *yamaka* that Bhoja manages so frequently, where the same sequence of syllables recurs in different words (with of course different meanings). His style is sweet and distinctive.

One may think that, by the time Bhoja was writing (11th century CE), in Sanskrit literature that had seen the genius of Vyāsa-Vālmīki, masters like Kalidāsa and Bāṇa, and hundreds of great poets, every possible beautiful idea or expression would already have been taken, that the “burden of history” would be too great, and there would just be no more room to write anymore in a classical style. (Such an argument is made in English literature, especially in poetry about not writing with metre and rhyme any more.) It's as if in science or mathematics one can stand on the shoulders of giants from past centuries, but when writing, the giants stand on your shoulders.

But the history of Sanskrit literature shows otherwise: somehow writers keep popping up who digest the entire literary tradition that came before them and produce something new and beautiful, like Bhoja, like Gaṅgādevi the author of Madhurā-vijaya, and for a modern-day example, like Dr. Shankar who can write *citrakāvya* better than anyone ever could.

Bhoja only wrote 5 kāṇdas (up to the Sundarakāṇda), and there is a story about this: that he was inspired to write this work the night before a battle, that as he finished the Sundarakāṇda it was time to go, and that he announced that the Yuddhakāṇda would be enacted in the battlefield against the invader, but sadly he never returned. Others have composed a Yuddhakāṇda to complete the work.

I have read Bhoja's Champu Ramayana only in bits and pieces, and would love to make the time to read it fully. There does not appear to be a complete digitized text of this work available online, but for anyone who wants to read it, here are some resources available:

## Text and commentary (scanned books)

## Translation

* By C. Lakshmi Narasmha Moorty, a [translation into English of the whole work](http://samkshiptasahityam.blogspot.com/2013/08/bhojarajas-champuramayanam.html) — not very readable by itself, but can be useful if trying to make sense of the text.

Vishvasa of Samskrita Bharati](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLal1Jj2nA8afaCWbgzfJNNFDtD9_Xp_cP), a little over 8 hours total, from the start of the work to the birth of Rāma and his brothers (just before Viśvāmitra approaches Daśaratha).

Promises to be great and very detailed, with lots of interesting information about grammar. :-)
* By Swami Tattvavidananda Saraswathi, in Telugu. About 9 hours, though with some audio and ordering issues (not clear where it starts or ends). Only listened to parts of it. Going by the numbering in the video titles: [1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsgYIMihL9Y), [2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPEiPtOBfyA), [3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUk2sZgNn3w), [4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YG4YLvrEcl8), [5](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHw6CVjAF3g), [6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ov1eo9sXOw4).
