I mentioned earlier my impression that this work *Chandogati* is structured like a mathematics book. If you've read enough of them, you'll be familiar with the experience of everything appearing to be straightforward, until you hit a chapter or section where the going suddenly gets tough, things are suddenly much more “nontrivial”, and you're no longer sure you understand everything. To me, that happened with this, the middle chapter of this book (*pariccheda* 5 of 9). Let's see how it goes :-)

Always starts with a summary that also simultaneously somehow elaborates and clarifies.<cite>103 0.081 0.474</cite>

To be attractive, it needs to be “different”, unusual — have a striking *gati*.<cite>103 0.452 0.673</cite><cite>104 0.107 0.429</cite>

Fn 33.<cite>103 0.673 0.908</cite>

Fn 34: We'll discuss “vṛtta-gandhi” gadya later.<cite>104 0.837 0.908</cite>

*gati* in SRK. He says ”gati is an arrangement of Ls and Gs that follows some system and is attractive”.  Lots of Gs $\implies$ vilamba-gati, lots of Ls $\implies$ druta-gati,<cite>104 0.428 0.833</cite>

and all combinations thereof: druta+madhya, etc.<cite>105 0.109 0.303</cite>

Fn 35: Examples of metres with druta etc. gati<cite>105 0.314 0.761</cite>

Fn 35 contd: Not the same as speed of recitation.<cite>105 0.752 0.913</cite><cite>106 0.241 0.803</cite>

Fn 35 contd: Teaser for something to come.<cite>106 0.797 0.912</cite>

Why does SRK go into this at all? gati-saundarya of gadya.<cite>105 0.261 0.303</cite><cite>106 0.112 0.226</cite><cite>107 0.113 0.602</cite>

But really, gati is hard to pin down in gadya<cite>108 0.109 0.290</cite>

Adduces Bhoja. [For the first time in this book, I see "ವಿವರಣೆ ಬೇಕೇ?" and feel "ಬೇಕು".]<cite>107 0.620 0.914</cite><cite>108 0.576 0.908</cite>

Rāga = pleasing scale (↗↘) of svaras. Gati = pleasing sequence of Ls and Gs. <cite>108 0.292 0.583</cite>

Such a pleasing *gati* carried out to some particular extent is a *pāda*; thence *padya*.<cite>109 0.106 0.202</cite>

Again: gati is not needed for definition; it simply follows as a consequence.<cite>109 0.206 0.453</cite>

Fn 37: Except for Vedic metre and the Vedic-like Anuṣṭup Śloka. (More on them in Chapter 9.)<cite>109 0.645 0.734</cite>

Fn 38: This "follows as a consequence" does not apply to the *trimūrti-gaṇa* in Kannada. See other part of other book.<cite>109 0.728 0.910</cite>

Yet Piṅgala seems [to SKB, as no one else seems to have noticed] to talk about them. Follows.<cite>109 0.446 0.521</cite>

Chapter 5, 1–9. (Of these, 6, 7, 8 are of interest; the rest included for context.)<cite>109 0.516 0.637</cite><cite>110 0.107 0.299</cite>

Explains the meanings of the others (1–5 and 9) and gets them out of the way; they were included for context.<cite>110 0.294 0.563</cite>

The meanings of **the three crucial sūtras.**<cite>110 0.556 0.726</cite>
