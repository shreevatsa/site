I mentioned earlier my impression that this work *Chandogati* is structured like a mathematics book. If you've read enough of them, you'll be familiar with the experience of everything appearing to be straightforward, until you hit a chapter or section where the going suddenly gets tough, things are suddenly much more “nontrivial”, and you're no longer sure you understand everything. To me, that happened with this, the middle chapter of this book (*pariccheda* 5 of 9). And I found myself wishing for some exercises at the end of the chapter, to check my understanding. Let's see how it goes :-)

Always starts with a summary that also simultaneously somehow elaborates and clarifies.<cite>103 0.081 0.474</cite>

To be attractive, it needs to be “different”, unusual — have a striking *gati*.<cite>103 0.452 0.673</cite><cite>104 0.107 0.429</cite>

Fn 33.<cite>103 0.673 0.908</cite>

Fn 34: We'll discuss “vṛtta-gandhi” gadya later.<cite>104 0.837 0.908</cite>

*gati* in SRK. He says ”gati is an arrangement of Ls and Gs that follows some system and is attractive”.  Lots of Gs $\implies$ vilamba-gati, lots of Ls $\implies$ druta-gati,<cite>104 0.428 0.833</cite>

and all combinations thereof: druta+madhya, etc.<cite>105 0.109 0.303</cite>

Fn 35: Examples of metres with druta etc. gati<cite>105 0.314 0.761</cite>

Fn 35 contd: Not the same as speed of recitation.<cite>105 0.752 0.913</cite><cite>106 0.241 0.803</cite>

Fn 35 contd: Teaser for something to come.<cite>106 0.797 0.912</cite>

Why does SRK go into this at all? gati-saundarya of gadya.<cite>105 0.261 0.303</cite><cite>106 0.112 0.226</cite><cite>107 0.113 0.602</cite>

But really, gati is hard to pin down in gadya<cite>108 0.109 0.290</cite>

Adduces Bhoja. [For the first time in this book, I see "ವಿವರಣೆ ಬೇಕೇ?" and feel "ಬೇಕು".]<cite>107 0.620 0.914</cite><cite>108 0.576 0.908</cite>

Rāga = pleasing scale (↗↘) of svaras. Gati = pleasing sequence of Ls and Gs. <cite>108 0.292 0.583</cite>

Such a pleasing *gati* carried out to some particular extent is a *pāda*; thence *padya*.<cite>109 0.106 0.202</cite>

Again: gati is not needed for definition; it simply follows as a consequence.<cite>109 0.206 0.453</cite>

Fn 37: Except for Vedic metre and the Vedic-like Anuṣṭup Śloka. (More on them in Chapter 9.)<cite>109 0.645 0.734</cite>

Fn 38: This "follows as a consequence" does not apply to the *trimūrti-gaṇa* in Kannada. See other part of other book.<cite>109 0.728 0.910</cite>

Yet Piṅgala seems [to SKB, as no one else seems to have noticed] to talk about them. Follows.<cite>109 0.446 0.521</cite>

Chapter 5, 1–9. (Of these, 6, 7, 8 are of interest; the rest included for context.)<cite>109 0.516 0.637</cite><cite>110 0.107 0.299</cite>

Explains the meanings of the others (1–5 and 9) and gets them out of the way; they were included for context.<cite>110 0.294 0.563</cite>

The meanings of **the three crucial sūtras.**<cite>110 0.556 0.726</cite>

These are not the names of 3 specific metres (vṛtta-s).<cite>111 0.110 0.492</cite><cite>112 0.100 0.238</cite>

Fn 39: The *trika* (*gaṇa*) trick probably originates with Piṅgala.<cite>111 0.495 0.695</cite>

Fn 40: SKB seems sure that Piṅgala 7.23, which stands out, is an interpolation (*prakṣipta*). [I don't see this confidence yet, but it doesn't really matter...]<cite>111 0.691 0.907</cite>

Fn 41: Jayakīrti and Hemacandra seem to have been puzzled too.<cite>112 0.433 0.651</cite>

Fn 42: Examples of the use of the word *tāna*.<cite>112 0.645 0.906</cite>

Fn 42 contd: Today, Hindustani and Carnatic music use *tāna* in different meanings, but hints of the original meaning remain.<cite>113 0.636 0.903</cite>

So what do these 3 sūtras indicate? A clue in ‘vitāna’. As ‘tāna’ = monotonous tone.<cite>112 0.191 0.418</cite>

So samānī = trochaic, pramāṇī = iambic.<cite>113 0.106 0.414</cite>

Examples.<cite>113 0.404 0.528</cite>

And Vitāna = the rest. See named examples of metres.<cite>113 0.522 0.619</cite><cite>114 0.098 0.232</cite>

Fn 43: reminder.<cite>114 0.776 0.901</cite>

So Samānī/Pramāṇī/Vitāna are not names of 3 *vṛtta*-s, but classification of all *vṛtta*-s into 3 *gati*.<cite>114 0.226 0.361</cite>

Why does Halāyudha give a weird commentary?<cite>114 0.360 0.651</cite>

Halāyudha was 10th century.<cite>114 0.642 0.760</cite>

By then Piṅgala's work was old; Jayadeva was popular and would have influenced.<cite>115 0.103 0.512</cite>

Jayadeva has mistake and Halāyudha didn't suspect.<cite>115 0.487 0.757</cite><cite>116 0.097 0.259</cite>

Fn 44: Some more polite criticism of everyone for not realizing that S/P/V are properties common to many.<cite>115 0.764 0.904</cite>

Another reason for not suspecting that S/P/V are not names of *vṛtta*s but are *gati*: they only considered vṛttas and strict mātrā bandhas... not trimūrti-gaṇa or solely tāla based. (These are discussed in music?) Gati is not usually discussed in chandaḥśāstra works.<cite>116 0.250 0.505</cite><cite>117 0.098 0.385</cite>

So why then does Piṅgala go into the topic at all? Maybe his predecessors did. So P mentioned briefly even though his system doesn't need it.<cite>117 0.385 0.876</cite><cite>118 0.107 0.229</cite>

Fn 45: Maybe vṛttas were classified by gati at some point, as rāgas were once divided into families based on their "feeling". Consider their names.<cite>118 0.397 0.659</cite>

Fn 46: Nice example of not ignoring predecessors: Hemacandra includes the uninteresting pratyaya.<cite>118 0.653 0.826</cite>

[I actually recognize this example: Sanskrit works on prosody (chandaḥśāstra) had a section on mathematics, where they discussed six problems or *pratyaya*s. (See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sanskrit_prosody&oldid=844798823#Chandas_and_mathematics).) Hemacandra, in his *Chandonuśāsana* (that is written much more clearly than earlier works), sees that one of them (the total space required to write them) is pointless and utterly mathematically uninteresting, and says so, but discusses it anyway.]

Anyway, doesn't matter why Piṅgala discussed it.<cite>118 0.223 0.380</cite>

Next begins Footnote 47, which touches 5 pages and is probably the most important thing in this chapter.

Fn 47: Piṅgala's samānī – pramāṇī – vitāna classification isn't satisfactory either.<cite>118 0.820 0.900</cite><cite>119 0.129 0.219</cite>

Fn 47 contd: Because a vṛtta like Vidyunmālā (GGGGGGGG), which has the maximum possible tāna, would be classified as “vitāna” under this classification. Similarly vṛttas that obviously have tāna, like Bhujaṅga-prayāta [LGG×4 in each pāda] and Toṭaka [LLG×4 in each pāda].<cite>119 0.215 0.430</cite>

Fn 47 contd: Maybe the Piṅgala text available to us is incomplete.<cite>119 0.404 0.885</cite>

Fn 47 contd: A proper classification would have more, as follows.<cite>120 0.131 0.221</cite>

Fn 47 contd: Proposes new system:  
• ēkatānī = repetition of G (like Vidyunmālā) or L.  
• pramāṇī, samānī = repetition of LG or GL respectively.  
• daṇḍakī = repetition of length 3 (any of the 8 trika gaṇas other than na=LLL or ma=GGG).  
= atidaṇḍakī = repetition of something longer.<cite>120 0.215 0.605</cite>

I find this clearer with some mathematical terminology. Consider the word – sequence over the alphabet $\{\mathsf{L}, \mathsf{G}\}$ – obtained by scansion of a *padya*. If this word is *periodic*, i.e. if the word $w$ can be written as $w = w_1 w_1 \dots w_1$ for some $w_1$ repeated some number ($>1$) of times, then the metre is called *satāna*. And the above classification is on the period (the length of $w_1$): period $1$ is ēkatānī, period $2$ is samānī or pramāṇī, period $3$ is daṇḍakī, and period $>3$ is atidaṇḍakī. (Note there are $2$ possible choices of "thing repeated" in *ēkatānī*, $2$ in {samānī, pramāṇī}, $6$ in daṇḍakī, etc.: the number of different possible "thing repeated" of length $1, 2, 3, 4, \dots$ is $2, 2, 6, 12, \dots$ as in [OEIS A027375](http://oeis.org/search?q=2%2C+2%2C+6%2C+12%2C+30%2C+54).)

Fn 47 contd: Examples of each. **Good to read and make sure you understand.**<cite>120 0.601 0.889</cite><cite>121 0.133 0.650</cite>

Fn 47 contd: Periodic, aperiodic. English has only satāna metres.<cite>121 0.650 0.726</cite>

Fn 47 contd: All satāna (periodic) are layānvita, and some vitāna ones are too. Other vitāna ones are without laya. (See named examples.)<cite>121 0.708 0.881</cite>

[TODO(shreevatsa): These are quite easy to understand with some examples. Add them.]

Fn 47 contd: Summary. [This is probably the main thing in this chapter.]<cite>122 0.560 0.898</cite>

Hints of gati: Piṅgala sometimes suggests how to read/recite.<cite>122 0.098 0.232</cite>

E.g. for Udgatā, which Halāyudha interprets as “read without pausing between pādas 1 and 2”.<cite>122 0.201 0.539</cite>

‘L’ at end of pāda 1 is not to be made ‘G’.<cite>123 0.106 0.332</cite>

But that's not it!<cite>123 0.330 0.491</cite>

He means read the whole *padya* as two halves (not as four separate pādas), with no pause either between pādas 1 and 2 **or** between 3 and 4.<cite>123 0.491 0.657</cite>

Read like:  
8|8|8|2–  
8|8|8|8.<cite>123 0.630 0.860</cite>

The “incomplete” chunk at the end (catalexis) is for pause. This is almost always seen in layānvita metres.<cite>123 0.831 0.888</cite><cite>124 0.106 0.210</cite>

(Read this carefully to understand.) Has 8–8–8–8, but like mṛdaṅga-playing, has variation.<cite>124 0.186 0.424</cite>

(Another example, TODO need to look this up to understand.)<cite>124 0.418 0.584</cite>

Other places where gati is indicated: let's see example of *tanumadhyā*<cite>124 0.561 0.874</cite>

Tanumadhyā, [GGLLGG]×4<cite>125 0.099 0.325</cite>

When read naturally, reads as:  
GGLL | GG— 
(four times). The laya is apparent only if pausing for 2 mātrās after each pāda. [I wonder: is this really unarguably true? What is natural? Why not —GG|LLGG say? To me it sounds like that may be possible too...]<cite>125 0.300 0.605</cite>

Thus it's clear that Piṅgala must have thought about gati. Another point in support: changing *yati* changes *gati*, resulting in different *vṛtta*s.<cite>125 0.603 0.903</cite>

Examples of three vṛttas all having pattern [L<sup>14</sup>G], but with different *yati* (and therefore different *gati*). (We'll look at a couple)<cite>126 0.099 0.307</cite>

One:  
4|4|4|4  
LLLL–LLLL–LLLL–LLG<cite>126 0.300 0.407</cite>

Another:  
6|6|4–  
LLLLLL–LLLLLL–LLG.
<cite>126 0.402 0.561</cite>

So, 4s and 6s respectively: āditāla/ēkatāla, and rūpaka-tāla respectively. [Unfortunately I don't know enough about tāla, and especially about setting words to tāla, to understand this properly.]<cite>126 0.556 0.743</cite>

Reiteration<cite>126 0.720 0.902</cite>

chandas = padya.  
What makes a padya distinctive is its gati, not just its laghu-guru-vinyāsa.<cite>127 0.106 0.548</cite>
