Gerald Weinberg's book *Are Your Lights On? How to Know What The Problem Really Is* begins as follows:

> ## Chapter 1. A Problem
>
> In the heart of Gotham City's financial district stands the glistening new 73-story Brontosaurus Tower. Even though this architectural masterpiece is not yet fully occupied, the elevator service has been found woefully inadequate by the tenants. Some tenants have actually threatened to leave if the service isn't improved, and quickly.
>
> A few facts of the case are as follows:
>
> 1. The building primarily houses offices doing business during the weekday hours of 9am to 5pm.
>
> 2. Nearly everyone using the building is associated in some way with the financial world.
>
> 3. The occupants are fairly uniformly distributed over the 73 floors, and so is the elevator traffic.
>
> 4. The owner has invested heavily in advertising in an attempt to rent the remaining office space.
>
> 5. Discouraging words spread like lightning in the tight little world of the financial district.
>
> ### WHAT IS TO BE DONE ABOUT THIS SITUATION?
>
> A number of ideas spring immediately to mind, such as:
>
> 1. Speed up the elevators.
>
> 2. Add elevators by cutting new shafts through the building.
>
> 3. Add elevators by constructing outside shafts.
>
> 4. Stagger working hours to spread the rush hour load over a longer period.
>
> 5. Move occupants to different floors to reduce total passenger traffic within the building.
>
> 6. Restrict the number of people entering the building.
>
> 7. Replace existing elevators with bigger cars stretching two or three stories.
>
> 8. Provide more services locally on each floor to reduce floor-to-floor traffic.
>
> 9. Reschedule the elevators with special local and express arrangements, as needed
>
> Having followed our natural problem-solving tendencies, we have rushed right into solutions. Perhaps it would be wiser to ask a few questions before stating answers.
>
> What sorts of questions? ***Who*** has the problem? What ***is*** the problem? Or, at this juncture, just what is ***a problem***?
>
> Consider the question, "Whose problem is it?" This question attempts to
>
> 1. determine who is the client—that is, who must be made happy
> 
> 2. establish some clues that may lead to appropriate solutions.
>
> Our first list of solutions, diverse as they were, all shared a single point of view—that the *elevator users* were the people with the problem.
>
> Suppose we try taking the point of view of Mr. Diogenes Diplodocus, the landlord. With him as our client, we might develop a rather different list, such as:
>
> 1. Increase the rents, so fewer occupants will be needed to pay off the mortgage.
>
> 2. Convince the occupants that Brontosaurus Tower is a terrific leisurely place to work because of the elevator situation.
>
> 3. Convince the occupants that they need more exercise—which they could get by walking the stairs rather than riding the elevators—by posting walking times and calorie consumption estimates over well- traveled routes.
>
> 4. Burn down the building and collect the fire insurance.
>
> 5. Sue the builder.
>
> 6. Steal elevator time from the next-door neighbor.
>
> These two lists, though not necessarily mutually exclusive, do show somewhat different orientations. This difference should arrest our natural tendency to produce hasty solutions before asking
>
> ### WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

I'm going to enjoy reading this book!
