This setup was supposed to help me write, but it's not doing that very successfully. I think even with all the allowances I give myself for incomplete sentences etc., there's still some overhead even in creating a post, choosing a title / excerpt, and finally, in committing it to the repo.

Right now it's like email or IM; needs to be like [`talk`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk_(software)).

To take that choice out of the loop, I'll probably start dumping everything in this file, and extract things when they are reasonably complete.

Sticking this at some random date in the middle, hope no one notices.

## Manjul HT

An article on the mathematician Manjul Bhargava, who won the Fields Medal in 2014, from 1997 when he was in his first year of grad school — in Hinduism Today: https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4868

------

A bit of background: Manjul Bhargava was born in Canada, but grew up in Long Island, New York, where his mother Mira Bhargava was/is a mathematician at Hofstra University. He spent summers in India, where his grandfather, P. L. Bhargava, was a noted Sanskritist (HOD of )

> out of the boy! Confident and proud of his Hindu culture and identity, this young Ontario-born son of a chemist father and mathematician mother has proven that he is truly Aryabhata's descendent in mind and spirit. This January he received the prestigious Frank and 

Unlike in India where merely affirming one's Hindu background is almost taken to be a political act, it seems possible elsewhere to have a more straightforward appreciation of one's inheritance. 

Though with other challenges…

------

> The family's staunch vegetarianism did cause some minor clashes in elementary school, but Manjul stood his ground: "Sometimes kids I ate with would make fun of me for not eating meat--'You've never had a hamburger in your life?' they'd ask incredulously. I would remind them that what they were eating were slices of dead cow and pig, and I'd relate cruel and gruesome stories of the slaughterhouse to them. This generally grossed them out enough to never make fun of vegetarianism again. In fact, afterwards many of them stopped eating meat altogether--at least in front of me!" 

Namely: one needs inoculation against many memes / forms of peer pressure; one needs to be much self-assured and confident. Where does that come from?

------

> He cheerfully admits: "I never really liked going to school, and so I rarely attended. Instead, I spent most of my childhood biking, playing tennis and basketball with neighborhood kids, writing, flying kites, reading recreational math books, and learning to play the sitar, guitar, violin and the tabla."
>
> Manjul, the winner of the First Annual New York State Science Talent Search, almost didn't graduate because of his carefree inclination to skip classes that couldn't teach him anything he didn't know already. After all, he had completed all his high school's math and computer courses by ninth grade! Still, he did manage to graduate--as the class valedictorian, no less.

Self-assurance / confidence, extending to knowing that education is much more than schooling (and definitely more than the games one plays to get a job or whatever), seems very important.

------

The last paragraph of [this article](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/manjul-bhargava-the-midas-touch-mathematician/article6309323.ece) says:

> He is also keenly interested in linguistics in which he has published research work. It was his grandfather, a linguistics scholar, who taught him Sanskrit and developed his interest in linguistics.

Wonder what this is?

## Snooping on DEK archives

Well it's on the public internet...

Sort by datetime.

1973: Some experiments with some Lisp-like language, and with SAIL, and a letter (by wife)

1974: More experiments with SAIL (more sophisticated), probably a memory dump of Greenblatt chess program,

1975: some "failed.txt" which are probably emails that didn't get sent (IIRC mutt also had something like that)

1976: ART(ACP) errata.

1976-03-21 21:33  TEST  .ART [  1,DEK]  1     4275 -- hmm interesting test data. What for?

1976-05-15 09:05  TEST  .ART [ART,DEK]  1     4475

Lots more errata etc. Also see a .XGP file. ("Errata et Addenda May 14 1976")

1976-09-21 23:49  DON   .SAI [ART,DEK]  5    34560 -- later version of above.

My guess is, this program converts from the ".MAS" files (see around there) to .PUB files? Some custom syntax to save typing?

Lots of errata etc files, all of these are interesting, but it would be good to first know what they are.

1976-10-29 11:11  SQRT  .SAI [  1,DEK]  1     7680 -- "Floyd's square root problem"

-- This is something interesting and I've seen nowhwere discussed. It appears that JFR = John Fredrick Reiser, one of DEK's PhD students. (Thesis: "Analysis of Additive Random Number Generators", 1977) (Also the author of this about SAIL: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=892120) And it appears that the "POX" system used was developed by REM ("I also thank Robert Maas for developing the typographical software"), and possibly invented the idea of a "brick" character. (There are POX manuals in other users' archives e.g. https://www.saildart.org/HOW.ALS[UP,DOC]7 .) Surely must have influenced TeX somewhat? The picture of the POX author post this period (what you can find on the internet) doesn't seem too great, sadly.

This by McCarthy mentions POX: http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/office/office.html

## Exercises in programming style

Started reading this book today. What an excellent idea! I encountered this book through a review. (I think [this one](https://henrikwarne.com/2018/03/13/exercises-in-programming-style/), via [this typically pointless discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16617039). There seems to be a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw4WJJoDl3U) but I haven't watched it.)

The problem it calls “term frequency”: given a text file, print out the N=25 most common words from it, along with their frequencies.

As in the review, I decided to try solving the problem myself, before reading the examples.

The approach that comes to mind, and what I think of as the “natural” way one (or just I?) would write this program today:

* Keep a map (dictionary) from words to counts: Given the text file, go over each word, incrementing its count in the dictionary.
* After this pass over the text file, you have the dictionary. Make a pass over the dictionary, sorting by *value* (the count). (Maybe keeping only the top N.)
* Print the set finally, in descending order.

Before I thought of actually writing the code, I recalled that something similar (perhaps the same problem?) was the exercise that Bentley gave to Knuth for writing a literate program, and the “review” by the Unix advocate (Doug Mcillroy IIRC?). So I could also write:

```sh
cat file.txt | tr ' ' '\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -n 25
```

or something like that.[^wcunix1] (Further tweaks to output if necessary.)

[^wcunix1]: (Actually trying this on the file [`2850-0.txt`](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2852) gives output like 
    ```
    3181 the
    2205

    1583 of
    1524 and

    1228 a
    1203 i
    1026 that
     897 in
     767 he
     733 was

     410 for
     406 we
     402 which
     393 as
     350 at
    ```
    so clearly some work is needed.)

When I actually thought of writing down Python code, though, a further shortcut suggested itself:

```py
from collections import Counter

c = Counter()
for line in open('file.txt').readlines():
    for word in line.split():
        c[word] += 1
for (word, count) in c.most_common()[:25]:
    print('%s - %s' % (word, count))
```

There are a bunch of assumptions implicit in all three approaches mentioned so far, which the prologue of the book (where the problem is first properly defined) shows are not actually correct:

* It is wished to ignore capitalization, and
* ’to ignore stop words like “the”, “for”, etc.’

There are many decisions that need to be made if one actually starts writing a program (notwithstanding the fact that we already wrote two programs without making any of these decisions explicitly):

* The first is “what is a word?”
  * The two programs above assumed, more or less, that words are that which are separated by spaces: roughly, that a word is a maximal sequence of non-space characters. (But even they differ when a line ends or starts with a space.)
  * Is this right? What about punctuation, say apostrophes? Surely "doesn't" shouldn't be split at the apostrophe. It seems we want “can't” and “cant”, or “won't” and “wont” to be different words after all—definitely “its” and “it's” aren't the same.
  * But in case of other punctuation, like dashes or full stops (periods), we probably shouldn't count them as part of the word: in the previous paragraph, the final “same.” isn't a word (it's only “same” that is a word), neither is “all—definitely” a single word.
  * What if a line ends with a hyphenated word? Can this happen, and should we detect this and join with the part on the next line?
  * Some linguists will sometimes say that things like “post office” are words; should we care?
* What does it mean to normalize for capitalization?
  * Should we convert everything to lowercase?
  * Or uppercase?
  * Or perhaps the “most common” case of the word should be retained, so that “I” can remain “I”?
  * Are “us” and “US” really the same word?
  * Perhaps we should also keep track of the actual distribution of different cases that a word occurred in, so that if we later decide we need to distinguish these, we don't have to re-read the input file?
* What is meant by ’to ignore stop words like “the”, “for”, etc.’?
  * What is “etc.”? What are the other stop words?
  * When should we ignore them: when reading the file (as early as possible) or perhaps not even in the final output (as late as possible), leaving it to the user to decide which ones are interesting or not?
  * The

## Proving that a number is prime

Imagine I am trying to convince you that a particular (large) number is composite (i.e. not a prime number). 

I could just give you the number and say “believe me, this is composite; check for yourself” but that might require an unfeasible amount of work on your part, and so would not be very convincing. 

Instead (if I knew everything about the number), I could give you an easy way to verify that the number is composite: to prove that a number $N$ is composite, I just have to give you a number $d$, such that $1 < d < N$ and  $d$ divides $N$. 

If the number $N$ is $L$ digits long, then I can give you such a $d$ having at most $\lceil L/2 \rceil$ digits, and you have to perform only a small computation: dividing an $L$ digit number by an $\lceil L/2 \rceil$-digit (or smaller) number. This requires not much computation from you, nor much mathematical knowledge beyond the definition of a composite number, and how to do division. The “certificate” is short as well.[^compnp]

[^compnp]: (In the terminology of computational complexity theory: This number $d$ serves as a short "certificate" of $N$'s compositeness. If $\mathrm{PRIMES}$ denotes the set of prime numbers and $\mathrm{COMPOSITES}$ denotes the set of composite numbers, then this proves that $\mathrm{COMPOSITES}$ is in the complexity class $\mathsf{NP}$. So by showing that the *complement* of $\mathrm{PRIMES}$ is in $\textsf{NP}$, it shows that that $\mathrm{PRIMES}$ is in the complexity class $\textsf{co-NP}$.)

----

Now imagine that I'm instead trying to convince you that a particular large number is prime. This time, I'm trying to prove the *non-existence* of something (divisors), and it is less obvious whether I can give you a short proof that the number is prime.[^primesnp]

[^primesnp]: In the terminology of computational complexity theory: showing that $\mathrm{PRIMES}$ is in $\textsf{NP}$ is less trivial. Of course, now we know, thanks to the celebrated work of [Manindra Agrawal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manindra_Agrawal), [Neeraj Kayal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neeraj_Kayal), and [Nitin Saxena](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitin_Saxena), that “$\mathrm{PRIMES}$ is in $\mathsf{P}$” — see [1](http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2004/160-2/p12), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AKS_primality_test), [3](http://www.ams.org/notices/200305/fea-bornemann.pdf), etc. This is even less trivial, so beyond the scope of our discussion. :-)

This was first shown by Vaughan Pratt in 1975 (three years after his PhD with Donald Knuth, and a year after the publication of the paper on the Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm). The number-theoretic core of the idea is an old one, dating back to Lucas in the mid-19th century, and D. H. Lehmer in 1927. The certificates (short proofs of primality) generated by this method are known as “Pratt certificates”.

These certificates are in fact easy to explain to a high-school student with no number-theory background, from first principles.[^todopratt]

[^todopratt]: (TODO: do this: pick $a$ relatively prime to $N$ and consider powers of $a$ modulo $N$, use pigeonhole-principle to establish that $a^r \equiv 1$ for some $r$, then use the coset argument to prove Lagrange's theorem for this case (gives Fermat-Euler theorem plus order divides $\phi(N)$), then show $\phi(N)$ can't be $N - 1$ if $N$ is not prime, and therefore the Lucas test / Lehmer's theorem, etc.)  Although it's explained at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Primality_certificate&oldid=842984422#Pratt_certificates) and [Pratt's short paper](http://boole.stanford.edu/pub/SucCert.pdf#page=3), here it is again.

I am not aware of software for finding these Pratt certificates. There is something close, in `pari`, when you invoke `isprime` and pass `1` as the second argument. It is documented [here](https://www-fourier.ujf-grenoble.fr/~parisse/giac/doc/en/cascmd_en/node43.html) (see also [here](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/faq.html#primetest), [here](https://pari.math.u-bordeaux.fr/archives/pari-announce-18/msg00006.html), [here](https://cs.stackexchange.com/a/23263/891)) as:

— I think I figured it out from [here](https://programmingpraxis.com/2012/09/28/pocklingtons-n-1-primality-prover/) (and a bit from [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/research/events/2012-2013/numbertheory/ntgc/talks/warwbeam.pdf), also [badly written on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pocklington_primality_test&oldid=807800293#Generalized_Pocklington_method)): instead of only showing that $a^{(n-1)/q} \not\equiv 1 \pmod N$, i.e. that $N \nmid (a^{(n-1)/q} - 1)$, we show that $N \perp  (a^{(n-1)/q} - 1)$ — using here $x \perp y$ to mean that $\gcd(x, y) = 1$ — and in return we only have to prove it for primes in some “factored part” of $(N - 1)$ that is at least $\sqrt{N}$.

Example:

```
pari.isprime(10000000000000000369475456880582265409809179829842688451922778552150543659347219597216513109705408327446511753687232667314337003349573404171046192448274699, 1)
```

```
[2, 2, 1; 773, 2, 1; 3430787131, 2, 1; 177830900711, 2, 1; 5736810279563022496918256153681231, 2, [2, 7, 1; 5, 2, 1; 11, 2, 1; 719090842404611, 2, 1]]
```

— this took something like 4 hours for a 155​-digit prime.

I'm not sure how to read this, but here are the facts:

* With N = 10000 00000 00000 00369 47545 68805 82265 40980 91798 29842 68845 19227 78552 15054 36593 47219 59721 65131 09705 40832 74465 11753 68723 26673 14337 00334 95734 04171 04619 24482 74699 (spaces for clarity), the factorization of N - 1 is [2 , 773 , 34307 87131 , 17783 09007 11 , 57368 10279 56302 24969 18256 15368 1231 , 18480 72574 75428 38412 29608 79808 05424 74912 36118 10555 00369 77261 35763 76775 78396 96558 97497 97900 37414 03]

* We can check that $2^{(N-1)/2} \not\equiv 1\pmod{N}$, that $2^{(N-1)/773} \not\equiv 1$, that $2^{(N-1)/3430787131} \not\equiv 1$, etc. Try the following in Sage:

  ```py
  fs = [2, 773, 3430787131, 177830900711, 5736810279563022496918256153681231, 1848072574754283841229608798080542474912361181055500369772613576376775783969655897497979003741403]
  
  product = 1
  for f in fs:
      product *= f
  product == N1 - 1
  
  for f in fs:
      print 2.powermod((N1 - 1) / f, N1) != 1
  ```

* Finally, we can generate similar certificates for each of those primes:

  ```py
  for f in fs:
      print f
      print pari.isprime(f, 1)
  ```

  gives

  ```py

A later development is “elliptic curve primality proving”: [Wikipedia 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Primality_certificate&oldid=842984422#Atkin%E2%80%93Goldwasser%E2%80%93Kilian%E2%80%93Morain_certificates), [Wikipedia 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elliptic_curve_primality&oldid=847730025), [paper 1](http://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~geo2/goldwasserkilian.pdf). This is what is used by the program [Primo](http://www.ellipsa.eu/public/primo/primo.html) by Marcel Martin, considered the gold-standard of primality-proving programs.
