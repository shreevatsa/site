This setup was supposed to help me write, but it's not doing that very successfully. I think even with all the allowances I give myself for incomplete sentences etc., there's still some overhead even in creating a post, choosing a title / excerpt, and finally, in committing it to the repo.

Right now it's like email or IM; needs to be like [`talk`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk_(software)).

To take that choice out of the loop, I'll probably start dumping everything in this file, and extract things when they are reasonably complete.

Sticking this at some random date in the middle, hope no one notices.

## Manjul HT

An article on the mathematician Manjul Bhargava, who won the Fields Medal in 2014, from 1997 when he was in his first year of grad school — in Hinduism Today: https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4868

------

A bit of background: Manjul Bhargava was born in Canada, but grew up in Long Island, New York, where his mother Mira Bhargava was/is a mathematician at Hofstra University. He spent summers in India, where his grandfather, P. L. Bhargava, was a noted Sanskritist (HOD of )

> out of the boy! Confident and proud of his Hindu culture and identity, this young Ontario-born son of a chemist father and mathematician mother has proven that he is truly Aryabhata's descendent in mind and spirit. This January he received the prestigious Frank and 

Unlike in India where merely affirming one's Hindu background is almost taken to be a political act, it seems possible elsewhere to have a more straightforward appreciation of one's inheritance. 

Though with other challenges…

------

> The family's staunch vegetarianism did cause some minor clashes in elementary school, but Manjul stood his ground: "Sometimes kids I ate with would make fun of me for not eating meat--'You've never had a hamburger in your life?' they'd ask incredulously. I would remind them that what they were eating were slices of dead cow and pig, and I'd relate cruel and gruesome stories of the slaughterhouse to them. This generally grossed them out enough to never make fun of vegetarianism again. In fact, afterwards many of them stopped eating meat altogether--at least in front of me!" 

Namely: one needs inoculation against many memes / forms of peer pressure; one needs to be much self-assured and confident. Where does that come from?

------

> He cheerfully admits: "I never really liked going to school, and so I rarely attended. Instead, I spent most of my childhood biking, playing tennis and basketball with neighborhood kids, writing, flying kites, reading recreational math books, and learning to play the sitar, guitar, violin and the tabla."
>
> Manjul, the winner of the First Annual New York State Science Talent Search, almost didn't graduate because of his carefree inclination to skip classes that couldn't teach him anything he didn't know already. After all, he had completed all his high school's math and computer courses by ninth grade! Still, he did manage to graduate--as the class valedictorian, no less.

Self-assurance / confidence, extending to knowing that education is much more than schooling (and definitely more than the games one plays to get a job or whatever), seems very important.

The last paragraph of [this article](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/manjul-bhargava-the-midas-touch-mathematician/article6309323.ece) says:

> He is also keenly interested in linguistics in which he has published research work. It was his grandfather, a linguistics scholar, who taught him Sanskrit and developed his interest in linguistics.

Wonder what this is?

## What is “science”?

It appears that the word “science” is used in a few different meanings:

1. A method for determining what is true: perfoming experiments, keeping an open mind, trying not to fool yourself, etc.
2. The set of facts determined via such methods.
3. “Science is what scientists do” or “science is what scientists believe” — the set of things commonly believed by scientists.

As for (1), it is the most valuable way we have of finding things that are true. If something disagrees with experiment it is wrong. And if something can be determined or demonstrated by experiment, it does not require any testimony of prior experts or appeal to authority; you can find out the truth for yourself. It is also difficult. In general, the more things we can bring under its purview the better, because our knowledge will become more certain.

For (2), note that it is necessarily always incomplete. Science is definitely not “finished”, as it is [said](https://hsm.stackexchange.com/questions/199/did-physicists-around-1900-really-believe-they-were-close-to-figuring-it-all-ou) some physicists thought at some point. Also, as said above, science is hard, and subtle. There are entire areas that would be valid objects for science, but for which we have not yet figured out the right experiments to run: either we're not sure how to measure, how to exclude other variables, our methods of measurement aren't good enough, etc. Nevertheless, the set we do have is extremely valuable, and the hope is that it will grow.

Another point: someone may determine something through “science” (1), without it becoming part of the mainstream scientific knowledge. Mendel's experiments were not known or accepted for a while, etc. Someone may not publish. A bunch of people may have done the experiments and arrived at some knowledge, but others are still sceptical as they haven't done the experiments themselves (either it's too hard or they haven't bothered to).

For (3), scientists are human too (read a few dozen posts on Retraction Watch), and there are enough examples of mistaken scientific consensus. (Consider the usual examples: nutrition science, psychology's replication crisis, Wegener and continental drift.) And again, scientists are human too and there is no doubt a subculture among the tribe of professional scientists, which comes with its own ingroup and outgroup markers, shared beliefs, etc., not all of which may be strictly scientific in the sense of (1) or (2). So when “scientists say...” or even “science says”, it's important to be clear whether it's (2) or (3).

Also (conversely?), we shouldn't use the fallibility of (3) to give up our respect and trust of (2) (as incomplete as it may be) and especially of (1). (More generally, beware of shifting meanings and “motte and bailey”—the authority/flaws of one shouldn't be used to impugn the same for another.)

Finally, there is “śāstra”, something like systematic study, or scholarship. In the West, only “science” (in some sense) has approached the rigour necessary (and only in recent centuries), so there is a lot of prestige attached to “science” — some of what is admired there actually applies to any (good) śāstra.

## Snooping on DEK archives

Well it's on the public internet...

Sort by datetime.

1973: Some experiments with some Lisp-like language, and with SAIL, and a letter (by wife)

1974: More experiments with SAIL (more sophisticated), probably a memory dump of Greenblatt chess program,

1975: some "failed.txt" which are probably emails that didn't get sent (IIRC mutt also had something like that)

1976: ART(ACP) errata.

1976-03-21 21:33  TEST  .ART [  1,DEK]  1     4275 -- hmm interesting test data. What for?

1976-04-28 10:29  TEMPO .ART [  1,DEK]  1     3510 -- similar

1976-05-15 09:05  TEST  .ART [ART,DEK]  1     4475

Lots more errata etc. Also see a .XGP file. ("Errata et Addenda May 14 1976")

1976-05-23 14:27  BIGART.XGP [ART,DEK]  1    84910

1976-06-10 01:18  DON   .SAI [ART,DEK]  1    33920 -- looks like something that compiles *to* PUB code.

1976-09-21 23:49  DON   .SAI [ART,DEK]  5    34560 -- later version of above.

My guess is, this program converts from the ".MAS" files (see around there) to .PUB files? Some custom syntax to save typing?

Lots of errata etc files, all of these are interesting, but it would be good to first know what they are.

1976-10-29 11:11  SQRT  .SAI [  1,DEK]  1     7680 -- "Floyd's square root problem"

Some christmas letters...

1977-01-17 09:54  OPTBP .SAI [  1,DEK]  1     2560 -- optimal boolean eval

1977-03-29 13:54  JFR   .POX [  1,DEK]  1   101120

-- This is something interesting and I've seen nowhwere discussed. It appears that JFR = John Fredrick Reiser, one of DEK's PhD students. (Thesis: "Analysis of Additive Random Number Generators", 1977) (Also the author of this about SAIL: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=892120) And it appears that the "POX" system used was developed by REM ("I also thank Robert Maas for developing the typographical software"), and possibly invented the idea of a "brick" character. (There are POX manuals in other users' archives e.g. https://www.saildart.org/HOW.ALS[UP,DOC]7 .) Surely must have influenced TeX somewhat? The picture of the POX author post this period (what you can find on the internet) doesn't seem too great, sadly.

This by McCarthy mentions POX: http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/office/office.html

BTW, compare this date with that of the galleys!

1977-04-22 19:38  BELCOR.BAI [  1,DEK]  1     9615 -- not sure how to read this, but possibly interesting.

1977-04-25 18:01  BELFST.SAI [  1,DEK]  1     2560 -- "convert Belfast tapes to ASCII"

1977-04-27 11:58  CORR  .ASC [  1,DEK]  1    11520
1977-04-27 12:00  VOL2A .ASC [  1,DEK]  1   175360
1977-04-27 12:03  VOL2B .ASC [  1,DEK]  1   126720

-- seem to be either dumps or actual souce of the entire text? In definitely some weird format though.

1977-04-27 13:51  BELCOR.SAI [  1,DEK]  1     6400 -- possibly companion to BELCOR.BAI above

1977-05-13 04:59  TEX1  .    [  1,DEK]  1    65280
1977-05-13 04:59  TEX1  .    [  1,DEK]  2    65280
1977-05-13 04:59  TEXDR .AFT [  1,DEK]  1    65280

Aha, here we begin!

1977-05-26 00:17  XGPIT .SAI [  1,DEK]  1     1920
1977-05-26 00:20  SPLINE.SAI [  1,DEK]  1    19200

-- I think these show that the fonts were more interesting.
