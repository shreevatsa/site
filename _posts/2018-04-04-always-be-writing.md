This setup was supposed to help me write, but it's not doing that very successfully. I think even with all the allowances I give myself for incomplete sentences etc., there's still some overhead even in creating a post, choosing a title / excerpt, and finally, in committing it to the repo.

Right now it's like email or IM; needs to be like [`talk`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/talk_(software)).

To take that choice out of the loop, I'll probably start dumping everything in this file, and extract things when they are reasonably complete.

Sticking this at some random date in the middle, hope no one notices.

## Manjul HT

An article on the mathematician Manjul Bhargava, who won the Fields Medal in 2014, from 1997 when he was in his first year of grad school — in Hinduism Today: https://www.hinduismtoday.com/modules/smartsection/item.php?itemid=4868

------

A bit of background: Manjul Bhargava was born in Canada, but grew up in Long Island, New York, where his mother Mira Bhargava was/is a mathematician at Hofstra University. He spent summers in India, where his grandfather, P. L. Bhargava, was a noted Sanskritist (HOD of )

> out of the boy! Confident and proud of his Hindu culture and identity, this young Ontario-born son of a chemist father and mathematician mother has proven that he is truly Aryabhata's descendent in mind and spirit. This January he received the prestigious Frank and 

Unlike in India where merely affirming one's Hindu background is almost taken to be a political act, it seems possible elsewhere to have a more straightforward appreciation of one's inheritance. 

Though with other challenges…

------

> The family's staunch vegetarianism did cause some minor clashes in elementary school, but Manjul stood his ground: "Sometimes kids I ate with would make fun of me for not eating meat--'You've never had a hamburger in your life?' they'd ask incredulously. I would remind them that what they were eating were slices of dead cow and pig, and I'd relate cruel and gruesome stories of the slaughterhouse to them. This generally grossed them out enough to never make fun of vegetarianism again. In fact, afterwards many of them stopped eating meat altogether--at least in front of me!" 

Namely: one needs inoculation against many memes / forms of peer pressure; one needs to be much self-assured and confident. Where does that come from?

------

> He cheerfully admits: "I never really liked going to school, and so I rarely attended. Instead, I spent most of my childhood biking, playing tennis and basketball with neighborhood kids, writing, flying kites, reading recreational math books, and learning to play the sitar, guitar, violin and the tabla."
>
> Manjul, the winner of the First Annual New York State Science Talent Search, almost didn't graduate because of his carefree inclination to skip classes that couldn't teach him anything he didn't know already. After all, he had completed all his high school's math and computer courses by ninth grade! Still, he did manage to graduate--as the class valedictorian, no less.

Self-assurance / confidence, extending to knowing that education is much more than schooling (and definitely more than the games one plays to get a job or whatever), seems very important.

The last paragraph of [this article](https://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/manjul-bhargava-the-midas-touch-mathematician/article6309323.ece) says:

> He is also keenly interested in linguistics in which he has published research work. It was his grandfather, a linguistics scholar, who taught him Sanskrit and developed his interest in linguistics.

Wonder what this is?

## Snooping on DEK archives

Well it's on the public internet...

Sort by datetime.

1973: Some experiments with some Lisp-like language, and with SAIL, and a letter (by wife)

1974: More experiments with SAIL (more sophisticated), probably a memory dump of Greenblatt chess program,

1975: some "failed.txt" which are probably emails that didn't get sent (IIRC mutt also had something like that)

1976: ART(ACP) errata.

1976-03-21 21:33  TEST  .ART [  1,DEK]  1     4275 -- hmm interesting test data. What for?

1976-04-28 10:29  TEMPO .ART [  1,DEK]  1     3510 -- similar

1976-05-15 09:05  TEST  .ART [ART,DEK]  1     4475

Lots more errata etc. Also see a .XGP file. ("Errata et Addenda May 14 1976")

1976-05-23 14:27  BIGART.XGP [ART,DEK]  1    84910

1976-06-10 01:18  DON   .SAI [ART,DEK]  1    33920 -- looks like something that compiles *to* PUB code.

1976-09-21 23:49  DON   .SAI [ART,DEK]  5    34560 -- later version of above.

My guess is, this program converts from the ".MAS" files (see around there) to .PUB files? Some custom syntax to save typing?

Lots of errata etc files, all of these are interesting, but it would be good to first know what they are.

1976-10-29 11:11  SQRT  .SAI [  1,DEK]  1     7680 -- "Floyd's square root problem"

Some christmas letters...

1977-01-17 09:54  OPTBP .SAI [  1,DEK]  1     2560 -- optimal boolean eval

1977-03-29 13:54  JFR   .POX [  1,DEK]  1   101120

-- This is something interesting and I've seen nowhwere discussed. It appears that JFR = John Fredrick Reiser, one of DEK's PhD students. (Thesis: "Analysis of Additive Random Number Generators", 1977) (Also the author of this about SAIL: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=892120) And it appears that the "POX" system used was developed by REM ("I also thank Robert Maas for developing the typographical software"), and possibly invented the idea of a "brick" character. (There are POX manuals in other users' archives e.g. https://www.saildart.org/HOW.ALS[UP,DOC]7 .) Surely must have influenced TeX somewhat? The picture of the POX author post this period (what you can find on the internet) doesn't seem too great, sadly.

This by McCarthy mentions POX: http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/office/office.html

See also www1.cs.columbia.edu/~kar/pubsk/seminar.ps --

> Tuesday January 31 (1989 or 1990?)
> Before the start of class􏰍 DEK presented certificates􏰍 typeset with a historic system called
> POX􏰍 to the trivia hunt participants.􏰎 He noted that this may well be the last time that POX would ever be used􏰍 since it will disappear when the machine SAIL is decommissioned

BTW, compare this date with that of the galleys!

1977-04-22 19:38  BELCOR.BAI [  1,DEK]  1     9615 -- not sure how to read this, but possibly interesting.

1977-04-25 18:01  BELFST.SAI [  1,DEK]  1     2560 -- "convert Belfast tapes to ASCII"

1977-04-27 11:58  CORR  .ASC [  1,DEK]  1    11520
1977-04-27 12:00  VOL2A .ASC [  1,DEK]  1   175360
1977-04-27 12:03  VOL2B .ASC [  1,DEK]  1   126720

-- seem to be either dumps or actual souce of the entire text? In definitely some weird format though.

1977-04-27 13:51  BELCOR.SAI [  1,DEK]  1     6400 -- possibly companion to BELCOR.BAI above

1977-05-13 04:59  TEX1  .    [  1,DEK]  1    65280
1977-05-13 04:59  TEX1  .    [  1,DEK]  2    65280
1977-05-13 04:59  TEXDR .AFT [  1,DEK]  1    65280

Aha, here we begin!

1977-05-26 00:17  XGPIT .SAI [  1,DEK]  1     1920
1977-05-26 00:20  SPLINE.SAI [  1,DEK]  1    19200

-- I think these show that the fonts were more interesting.

## Unexpected application of Lagrange's theorem

```
Oct  2: Warning: Due to a known bug, the default Linux document viewer
        evince prints N*N copies of a PDF file when N copies requested.
        As a workaround, use Adobe Reader acroread for printing multiple
        copies of PDF documents, or use the fact that every natural number
        is a sum of at most four squares.
```

Possibly from October 2009.
