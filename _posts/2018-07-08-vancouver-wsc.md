(I was going to write something proper, but having not touched this in a while I'm just dumping what I have, without context and without even reading it. Hope there's nothign embarrassing.)

## Background

As someone trying to read some Sanskrit poetry occasionally, one of the challenges I ran into was

## 2018-07-08, Sunday

Arrived in Vancouver. The multilingualism (bilingualism) is nice, and reminds me of home (India): already on the flight there were announcements in English and French, and after landing in Vancouver I see in the airport all signs in English and French, and many with Chinese too. There's a also a bit of Punjabi (Gurmukhi script), among others. One does see Spanish in California, but not as pervasively I think.

The taxi ride from the airport to the UBC campus had great views of the city. (The driver said I was the third passenger he was driving to UBC for the Sanskrit conference!) The city looks really beautiful. Some residential areas of it were reminiscent of those of Seattle, which I visited recently. We drove over a bridge. I think it may be that the region we covered (and where UBC is) is not the "main" part of Vancouver (downtown etc), which probably looks different. And finally, when at UBC (I took a walk later), there's a very distinct and familiar feeling of being on a university campus (which I miss from my Cambridge/Boston days, as I realized recently when I visited Berkeley).

Checking in into the hostel (not a typo: hostel, not hotel -- staying on the UBC campus in probably the dorm room of someone who's away for the summer) was quite a long wait. There were a lot of people, and a lot of energy in the air. The WSC is not a specialist but a "big tent" conference, somewhat like (going by what I've heard) the JMM in mathematics. E.g. there are 504 speakers at the regular paper sessions alone, then there are special panels.... There were a lot of people in the area (later I learned the rooms don't have any easy way of getting internet, which may explain why there were so many here!), most of them attending the conference. Among a group of people nearby I glanced at badges and noticed Johannes Bronkhost. I've seen a bit of his work and he didn't look like what I'd expected, except in one aspect that his demeanour seemed like one of those who are pretty confident of things. :-)

Aside: An interesting moment happened during checking in. There was a queue of people being served (apparently: the lines were fuzzy and nothing was very clear), and after one person was done and left, the next were a white couple who were still standing a fair distance from the "counter". An Indian guy who was next in line, probably in a bit of a hurry, asked them something to the effect of: are you waiting in this line? They said something, which was not very clear. He must have understood it as "no", and approached the counter, presumably reasoning that as they were not doing so, they were probably not interested. At this, the white guy got angry, said "she hasn't called me yet" and shooed him away, and muttered something about "Indians" in an annoyed tone. No doubt one can be disconcerted by how things tend to be done in other cultures (e.g. "ask" v/s "guess" cultures, high power distance v/s low, etc), but placing blame aloud in that way takes something... I found it an interesting example that among those studying Sanskrit, there are those who hold negative attitudes towards Indians in general. (This is of course nothing new; recall the comment by Stella Sandahl, a noted professor in the Western Indological tradition, that described (Indian) enthusiasts of spoken Sanskrit as "vandals" and insinuated that they were engaged in "raping nuns". Such examples are many….)

Anyway the check-in when it actually happened was smooth, and the hostel room was clean and adequate. But reminds me that students don't always live in great conditions, as one needs to go to a different floor for the bathroom/restroom unless one's gender happens to match that of the restrooms on that floor. Shouldn't be a big deal for a week though.

Ran into Arjun (whom I know) and Manjushree (of whom I've heard many great things) on the way to the room. Couldn't talk much then; hope I'll catch up with them eventually. Later (it was almost 9, and the sun was beginning to set) I went for a walk, to buy toothpaste/soap, and check out a pizza place that was still open (just north of where the campus ends).

About the multiple languages mentioned earlier: earlier at the airport, and again now around the campus, I also noticed something written with what looked like IPA symbols. (The superscript w, the theta, etc.) I'll have to look up later what this is, but my guess is that this is some Native American language local to the region, for which some modern linguist has devised a script. Another reason for this guess is that there were some Native-American (looking) sculptures / statues, which I forgot to take a photograph of. (Maybe tomorrow.) I don't know what the status of this culture is, but this reminder makes me a bit sad, that the Native American culture, like that of so many "heathens" everywhere, has in so many places been reduced (under the closely related threats of Christianity and atheism[^monozero]) to that of curiosities, somewhat obscure/exotic even in its homeland and only the stuff of museums and textbooks, and not much of a voice of its own. (I don't know if this is the situation in Canada here and will have to look it up later, but going by what we see in the US, in Australia, etc.) At the same time, the names and statues also made me glad that the culture has not been entirely erased, and at least these markers exist, so that when some "utpatsyate samānadharmaḥ", they may rouse similar emotions as their original makers intended.

[^monozero]: There is not much difference between the apparently opposed monotheisms and atheism, as the atheists themselves often argue: both of them reject all the gods. And I'd add: both are curiously preoccupied with what is a "correct" belief or faith, rather than with experiences or practices / traditions.

Came back to the hostel and started typing this "diary". There's no internet, so not much distractions. Actually writing this diary is itself a distraction (a la "structured procrastination") from what I *should* be doing, which is preparing for my talk. :-)

Need to wake up early tomorrow as things start from 8am, and there's breakfast before that (so maybe should aim to bathe by 7am at the latest). Better check out the bathrooms so I can get in early. :-)

First went to “Jaina Studies” room, learn something about mātrās: no-show.

Then went to “Sanskrit pedagogy”: presenter not there either.

Both were Indians, and in the (predominantly Indian) audience, I heard someone mention about a “certificate”. Oh well...

In both rooms, they mentioned this happening yesterday as well.

"Can we integrate all available digital learning resources? (Vyoma Labs has 20+ products)"

No one should *have* to do this work again — they can if they want

Your work may be used in unusual ways. That is ok, same with ideas.
