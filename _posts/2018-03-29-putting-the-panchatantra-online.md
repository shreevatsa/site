# The Panchatantra, in English and Sanskrit

Going to be put up on GitHub Pages: https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/#usage-limits

When I started this over 10 years ago, the only scan of Ryder's translation of the Panchatantra that I could find online was on DLI: [dead link now]

Now there are many, for example:

- https://archive.org/details/Panca_tantra_Ryder1935
- https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.37110
- https://archive.org/details/ThePanchatantraEnglish-AwRyder
- https://archive.org/details/Panchatantra_Arthur_W_Ryder
- https://archive.org/details/TFIC_ASI_Books/Panchatantra

(TODO: Maybe link all the above to a specific page in "stream" view.)

I OCRed and proofread the text, typing a few pages in.

Today, a fully digitized and proofread text exists on Wikisource: <https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Panchatantra_(Purnabhadra%27s_Recension_of_1199_CE)>

It appears that it was even the featured text recently, in May 2017.

So the main remaining contribution here is to make a start at aligning the Sanskrit and English.
