TLDR: If your internet searches for "CCITTFaxDecode" don't give results of much relevance, try searching for "CCITT" along with "group 4", etc.

Inside a PDF file you may encounter parts that are compressed and meant to be uncompressed (decoded) with the `/CCITTFaxDecode` filter.

This "CCITTFaxDecode" (see section 3.3.5 of the [PDF reference](https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference_archive.html)) refers to the "CCITT facsimile (fax) encoding", itself an informal name for "Recommendations T.4 and T.6 of the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)". It also happens to be used as one of the possible compression options in TIFF files, but is not otherwise connected to TIFF.

## What is the CCITT Group 4 encoding?

Suppose you have a monochrome (aka bitonal, aka black-and-white) bitmap image, i.e. a sequence of 0s and 1s, like the following crude drawing of the digit "3":

    0111110
    0000010
    0011110
    0000010
    0111110
    
(Or more realistically, the data from a black-and-white scan of a piece of paper, being done inside a fax machine.) The goal is to compress it.

The CCITT algorithm is an ad-hoc encoding scheme that is intended to achieve somewhat reasonable compression for typical documents.

There are actually a few schemes, with names like "Group 3" (itself in multiple variants) and "Group 4", but because Group 4 is what I encountered and care about right now, I'll only focus on Group 4.

There are basically two ideas:
- Each scanline (e.g. each row in the example above) tends to have runs of 0s and runs of 1s, so we can encode the run lengths. (Used in both 
- Each scanline tends to be similar to the one just above, so we can encode the differences.

For example, we could just describe the positions of where each run begins (called the "changing element"). And we could describe these positions *either* relative to the previous changing element in the same line (the length of the run, basically) *or* relative to a changing element in the previous line ("vertical mode coding"). This is precisely what the Group 4 (aka G42D) scheme does. Here's a figure from the official documentation:

![]({{ "/assets/pdf-format/CCITT-figure-4.png" | absolute_url }})

When we're at a0 and want to describe the position of a1, either

- a1 is very close to b1 (absolute difference 3 or less), in which case we describe a1 as {0, 1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3} pixels away from b1, with a specific code for each of the 7 cases. (called "vertical mode coding"), or
- a1 is to the right even of b2, in which case we record it as a "pass" and pretend that a0 is now just below b2, 
- else we record the offsets of a1 and a2 using the run lengths (called "horizontal mode coding")

## How to decode?

The encoding scheme is quite clearly described in the official reference (linked below), if you read past the first page of officialese. I almost started writing my own decoding program, but after seeing a few code examples (also linked below), decided that it was unnecessary.

Instead a trick can be used: as [TIFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagged_Image_File_Format) files can contain data compressed by CCITT Group 4 (or "CCITT T.6 bi-level encoding"), we can, by wrapping our data in an appropriate header, treat it as a TIFF file! If the data happens to be image data (which is likely true in trusted, non-malicious cases), then we can use all the tools that work with TIFF files to extract our image into other formats.

And indeed such code is much easier to write. Using code snippets by Sergey Shashkov (see e.g. [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34555398/4958), [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/34555343/4958), [here](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/comp.text.pdf/ZmrRgJNssLw/j8zKsk4SBgAJ)), we can do something like the following:

    import struct
    
    def tiff_header_for_CCITT(width, height, img_size, CCITT_group=4, blackIsZero=False):
        """Returns the appropriate header that will make it a valid TIFF file."""
        tiff_header_struct = '<' + '2s' + 'h' + 'l' + 'h' + 'hhll' * 8 + 'h'
        return struct.pack(tiff_header_struct,
                           b'II',  # Byte order indication: Little-endian
                           42,  # Version number (always 42)
                           8,  # Offset to first IFD
                           8,  # Number of tags in IFD
                           256, 4, 1, width,  # ImageWidth, LONG, 1, width
                           257, 4, 1, height,  # ImageLength, LONG, 1, length
                           258, 3, 1, 1,  # BitsPerSample, SHORT, 1, 1
                           259, 3, 1, CCITT_group,  # Compression, SHORT, 1, 4 = CCITT Group 4 fax encoding
                           262, 3, 1, int(blackIsZero),  # Threshholding, SHORT, 1, 0 = WhiteIsZero
                           273, 4, 1, struct.calcsize(tiff_header_struct),  # StripOffsets, LONG, 1, len of header
                           278, 4, 1, height,  # RowsPerStrip, LONG, 1, length
                           279, 4, 1, img_size,  # StripByteCounts, LONG, 1, size of image
                           0  # last IFD
                           )
    
    def decode_ccitt_data(data, width, height, CCITT_group=4, blackIsZero=False):
        """Decodes CCITT-encoded data, if its intended width, height, etc are known."""
        img_size = len(data)
        tiff_header = tiff_header_for_CCITT(width, height, img_size, CCITT_group)
        return tiff_header + data
    
    def decode_cccitt_data_to_file(data, width, height, out_filename, CCITT_group=4, blackIsZero=False):
        with open(out_filename, 'wb') as img_file:
            img_file.write(decode_ccitt_data(data, width, height, CCITT_group, blackIsZero))

One of the future posts will show an example where this trick was useful.
