I'd like to be less “read-only”, and not spend all my time only “consuming”. Life is short, and as I get older so is my memory.

To induce myself to write up things more often, I'm trying this site as an experiment, removing as many barriers to writing as possible. I'm allowing myself to write posts that:

- can have spelling mistakes, gramamtical mystiakes, and everytghing goes

- need not be fully written; in fact there's no such thing as a “draft” and everything is ok to post as soon as I start writing it,

- need not even contain full sentences; perfectly ok to have sentence fragments or cryptic notes that wouldn't make sense even to me a few days later

- can be incoherent ramblings, can be mere outlines or plan for future posts, can lose the main thread and digress into trivialities, can say stupid things, incorrect things,

- have no minimum length; even if I think of a single word or phrase it's ok to post,

- can be repetitive and keep going in circles even when the point is obvious.

I was inspired by [this “shitpost“ blog](https://blog.plover.com/meta/shitpost.html), especially [posts like this one](https://shitpost.plover.com/w/water-pik.html). Of course, I cannot aspire to the same level of quality or interestingness that even those “shitposts” have; instead I can hope to exceed the shittiness.

On removing barriers: Tom Lehrer:

> there is something the New York Times said about me, that I have always treasured: “Mr. Lehrer's muse is not fettered by such inhibiting factors as taste.”
